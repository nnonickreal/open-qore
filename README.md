an open-source toolkit to patch, modify, and enhance the firmware of soundcore q-series headphones, with future support for other models planned.

> **note:** this project is my personal journey into the world of hardware reverse-engineering and embedded systems. it was created by a teenager and i'm learning as i go. expect bugs, mistakes, and lots of fun. all contributions and advice are welcome!

## supported devices

this project was started with the soundcore life q35. support for other devices is a community goal. if you want to help test or add support for a new model, please open an issue!

| model | chipset | status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| soundcore life q35 | bes2300p | ✅ **supported** |
| soundcore life q30 | bes2300p | ❔ *untested, but should work* |
| soundcore life tune pro | bes2300p | ❔ *untested, but should work* |
| soundcore life tune | bes2300p | ❔ *untested, but should work* |

**support for other models is a future goal!**

> **note:** devices based on the `bes2300p` chipset are the most likely candidates for future support.

## acknowledgements

this project was brought to life with the extensive use of ai-powered coding assistants (like claude and chatgpt). while the core reverse-engineering, research, and architectural decisions were made by the author, ai played a crucial role in accelerating the development process, writing boilerplate code, and debugging.

this is a modern project built with modern tools.
